This was created for my learning/practicing VBA for future references
As part of the data science/analytics boot camp this will help further digest the new VBA

This VBA code was to simplify or one click VBA code to garner new data from a dataset.
Instead of having to create arithmatic functions for each rows/column, color code each cell, and reduce human toil for data set over 70k rows.
